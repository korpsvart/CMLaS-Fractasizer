## 1. Description
Implementation of a plug-in, based on fractal systems using C++ and the JUCE framework, that modifies a midi input signal.

The idea of the project is to use the coordinates of the points, yielded by iterative applications of these formulas, to control the parameters of an oscillator.

The final sound is generated by adding multiple sinusoidal components and the parameters of each of these components will be controlled by the values of the points obtained by iterating the chosen fractal succession.

We considered a total of 4  partials, so only the first 4 values of the fractal succession will be computed, starting from a specific user-provided point. 

In particular:
*  the real part ( x  coordinate) of the points will control the frequencies of the partials;
*  the imaginary part ( y  coordinate) of the points will control the rate of a vibrato effect applied on the partials.

The available fractals to use are three:
* Mandelbrot
* Burning Ship
* Tricorn

## 2. GUI
### Single partials area
* Waveform Combo Boxes: allows the user choose the partial waveform between:
     sine wave, saw wave, square wave.
* ADSR knobs: 4 knobs used to control the amplitude envelope of the partial: one for the attack, one for the sustain, one for the decay and one for the release.
* Wave visualization areas:
    a component that allows the user to see the real-time evolution of the the generated partial.

### Fractals control area
* Fractals Combo Box: used to change the computed fractal succession between the three available fractals.
* Input plane: a plane where the user can click to select the starting point for the fractal succession computation.
* X slider: used to select the x coordinate of the starting point.
* Y slider: used to select the y coordinate of the starting point.
